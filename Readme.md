# Order Processing API

This project is a Node.js application built with Express that interacts with an external API to fetch, filter, and process orders based on a saved timestamp. The application uses Axios for making HTTP requests and stores timestamps in a local file to track the most recent orders processed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-processing-api.git
   cd order-processing-api

	2.	Install the dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API credentials:

CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
API_KEY=your_api_key
TOKEN=your_token


	4.	Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check this by running:

node -v

If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from the official Node.js website.

	5.	To start the server, run:

node index.js

The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
